## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository.

The first step to start coding is cloning the [vanillajs boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello) on your local computer or opening it using gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod (recommended) you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello`.
```

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üìùInstructions

1. Create your HTML/CSS. First, we recomend using a parent div with `display:flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` (to allow multiple rows), the container must have 100 divs inside.
2. After your HTML/CSS looks good, start thinking on how to make it dynamic using JS.
3. To represent the gameBoard you can use a JS matrix like this:

```js
// 0 = empty
// 1 = part of a ship
// 2 = a sunken part of a ship
// 3 = a missed shot
let gameBoard = [
    [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
];
```
4. Add one onClick to every `<div>` and call the `fireTorpedo` function with the coordinates of the div.
5. Replace the value on the gameBoard and render the board again.

## üòé Feeling confident?

+ Try implementing a "showShips" function that shows the ship positions when clicked.
